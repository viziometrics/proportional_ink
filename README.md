# Proportional Ink

This project aims to identify barcharts that violate principle of [proportional ink](https://callingbullshit.org/tools/tools_proportional_ink.html). As part of this project, a framework is developed to automatically extract numeric axes labels of barcharts. 

Given a path to a folder of images (image_dir), this framework extracts individual graphs from compound figures (Figure Separator), identifies bar charts among them (Bar Classifier) and extracts labels for barcharts (Label Extractor). The outputs are annotated images in a specified folder(image_output_dir) and labels as csv file in a specified folder(csv_output).

For separating figures, we used open source application [Compound Figure Separator](https://github.com/apple2373/figure-separator) which is an implementation using a covolutional neural network (CNN). For classifying bar charts,we applied transfer learning and used RESNET-50 pre-trained model as weight intialization scheme. This model is integrated with a 3 layer neural network built using Keras. For extracting labels, we used open source repository [Scatteract](https://github.com/bloomberg/scatteract).Scatteract is a framework to automatically extract data from the image of scatter plots. We modified the code to extract labels from bar charts.
